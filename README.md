#homework

Homework (a working title) is a new-tab override page for Chrome. Keep your assignments on your mind and easily reference what's due soon without the fuss of complicated calendar apps that are more focused on events than due dates and timelines.

The goal of Homework is to be accessible & visual, to help students like myself who have ADHD or general memory & attention problems. I find that navigating multiple menus to enter or access due dates trains me to never do it, or putting it out of sight also means out of mind when the app is closed. Homework will keep nudging you as you browse the web, without intrusive notifications.

Also, it's just pretty. :sparkles:

Right now Homework is an html & css prototype, with styling based loosely on the earlier work of [Jan Tschichold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Tschichold).
